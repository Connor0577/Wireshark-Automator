# Wireshark-Automator
**This program I made works specifically for my laptop due to the coordinates on the screen**
This is a wireshark automator. It will ask you how long you want to capture packets and email you a pcapng report 
whenever that specified time is done. 
I uploaded a demonstration video that shows it is automated through pyautogui and really only takes one input to generate a 
pcapng file!
